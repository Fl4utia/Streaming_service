# Streaming_service
The rise of on-demand video streaming services, like Netflix and Disney+, has spurred substantial growth. In this course, our task is to model a streamlined video streaming service, focusing on movies and series. We'll leverage Object-Oriented Programming principles—inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading—to build a system that supports future service providers. The end goal is an application generating custom reports, offering insights like genre-specific movie lists or rated movie selections. Throughout the project, we'll apply OOP best practices to create an efficient, flexible solution for modeling a video streaming service.
